== Welcome to Treegeek

This is the app I'm using to learn about RAILS and MongoDB.

What does it do?  Well, mostly lots of random things.  Basically, we plant lots of trees.  And I really wanted to remember what
went where, what species was it, how tall was it when it went in, where did I get it from, and perhaps how it was doing in its life;
given the fact that these are mostly NZ natives, this will typically mean much much longer than my life--unless the rabbits have a say.
